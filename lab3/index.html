			<h1>Lab 3 File Structures</h1>
			<p>The idea of this lab was to make a local file structure and practice adding our own html indexes.</p>
		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>It was easy creating the file structure, because in fact I did not have to make it. It was already there! I didnt even have to make a new html index as there
		was already one there.</p>
	<h2>Results</h2>
