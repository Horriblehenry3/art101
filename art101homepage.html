		<h1> Hello! My name is Henry Merry</h1>


		<p>I am a man of many interests. Music makes up most of me. I write my own music and nothing matches the feeling of writing a song. I am an explorer, as well as a son of an explorer. I would dive into the sea, hike a hundred miles, explore caves deep beneath the earth and jump out of a plane. I crave adventure. But i also am an expert at relaxing, I am majoring in hammock science. I love all sorts of art, but mainly music and film. I can be really social, but i do have to put on a persona to really dive into it. Im a tinkerer and a builder, an audiophile, and a bit of a bohemian. </p>
