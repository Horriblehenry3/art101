		<h2> Problems </h2>
		<p> Coming up with steps for the task was difficult due to the ambitious nature of my idea. Also, we ran into minor problems regarding task 4 the css was a hard hurdle for me and Henry becuase this was our first time making our websites look pretty, we also had trouble getting the right screenshot in but that was mostly a problem that I had locally with the snipping tool on my computer and not with the actual html code. </p>
